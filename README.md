<h1>Book Recommender System Using AI and ML</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Book Recommender System! This project aims to recommend books to users based on their preferences using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The system is built with Python and utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for development and data analysis. Additionally, we use Pickle for model serialization and deserialization to streamline the recommendation process.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User-Based Collaborative Filtering</strong>: Recommends books based on the similarity between users.</li>
    <li><strong>Item-Based Collaborative Filtering</strong>: Recommends books based on the similarity between books.</li>
    <li><strong>Popularity-Based Filtering</strong>: Recommends books based on the Popularity(e.g., Top 50 books of all time).</li>
    <li><strong>Hybrid Model</strong>: Combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for enhanced recommendations.</li>
    <li><strong>Serialization with Pickle</strong>: Saves and loads trained models using Pickle for efficient predictions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.6+</li>
    <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
    <li>pandas</li>
    <li>numpy</li>
    <li>scikit-learn</li>
